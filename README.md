# 4-Servo-Motor-Control-Arduino
This project demonstrates how to control four servo motors using an Arduino. The program runs a sweeping motion for each servo for 2 seconds, then locks all servos at 90 degrees.

# Features
- Controls 4 servo motors simultaneously.
- Simulates sweep motion for 2 seconds (like the built-in Servo example).
- Holds all motors at 90 degrees afterward.

# Tools uesd 
| Tool                        | Purpose                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Arduino IDE                 | Writing and uploading code |
| Servo.h                     | Servo control library      |
| Arduino Uno (or compatible) | Microcontroller            |

# How It Works
All four servos sweep from 0° to 180° and back for 2 seconds.

After sweeping, the servos are set and held at a fixed angle of 90°.

# Circuit Design
This project was designed and simulated using Tinkercad Circuits.
